# In name of Allah

## Introduction
You need to develop a simple CMS (Content Managing System) application, this CMS contains two parts:
- add content page: in this page there is a simple form which gets these data from user:
  - title
  - text
  - keywords
  - image
- view content page: in this page (which can be viewed by providing parameter :title in url path) you can view the contents you have added before with a default layout.

### Note
Do not use any framework, it must be developed with pure PHP. Also note that for storing contents you have to use mySQL database.

## Expectations

So What does matter to us?
- a clean structure of codebase & components
- clean code practices
- well handled exceptions
- finally, ability to learn
